## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks are applied to classify traffic signs. The trained model should classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, it is also tested on pictures found on internet.



To meet specifications, the project will require submitting three files: 
* the Ipython notebook with the code **Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb**
* the code exported as an html file **Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html**
* a writeup report either as a markdown or pdf file **writeup.md**


You're not required to use markdown for your writeup.  If you use another method please just submit a pdf of your writeup.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies
This lab requires:
